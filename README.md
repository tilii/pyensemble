pyensemble v0.41
================

###### An implementation of [Caruana et al's Ensemble Selection algorithm] (http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~caruana/ctp/ct.papers/caruana.icml04.icdm06long.pdf) [1][2] in Python, based on [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org).

###### From the abstract:

> We present a method for constructing ensembles from libraries of thousands of models.
Model libraries are generated using different learning algorithms and parameter settings.
Forward stepwise selection is used to add to the ensemble the models that maximize its
performance.  Ensemble selection allows ensembles to be optimized to performance metrics
such as accuracy, cross entropy, mean precision or ROC Area.  Experiments with seven test
problems and ten metrics demonstrate the benefit of ensemble selection.

It's a work in progress, so things can/might/will change.

#### __ensemble.py__

Containing the EnsembleSelectionClassifier object

The EnsembleSelectionClassifier object tries to implement all of the methods in the combined
paper, including internal cross validation, bagged ensembling, initialization with the best
models, pruning of the worst models prior to selection, and sampling with replacement of the
model candidates.

It uses sqlite as the backing store containing pickled unfitted models, fitted model 'siblings'
for each internal cross validation fold, scores and predictions for each model, and the list of
model ids and weightings for the final ensemble.

Hillclimbing can be performed using auc, __logloss__, accuracy, rmse, cross entropy or F1 score.

If the object is initialized with the _model_ parameter equal to None, the object tries to load
a fitted ensemble from the database specified.

__*(NOTE: Expects class labels to be sequential integers starting at zero [for now].)*__
    
#### __model_library.py__

Example model library building code.

#### __ensemble_train.py__

Training utility to run ensemble selection on svm data files.

The user can choose from the following candidate models:

*    sgd     : Stochastic Gradient Descent
*    svc     : Support Vector Machines
*    gbc     : Gradient Boosting Classifiers
*    lgb     : LightGBM classifier
*    dtree   : Decision Trees
*    logit   : Logistic Regression Classifier
*    forest  : Random Forests
*    extra   : Extra Trees
*    kmp     : KMeans->LogisticRegression Pipelines
*    kernp   : Nystroem Approx->Logistic Regression Pipelines

Some model choices are __very slow__.  The default is to use decision trees, which are reasonably fast.

The simplest command line is:

    unix> ./ensemble_train.py some_dbfile.db some_data.svm

__*(NOTE: Expects 'some_dbfile.db' not to exist, and will quit if it does [so you don't accidentally blow away your model].)*__
